                        We have a simple goal: <strong>Stop wasting food and start sharing it.</strong>

                    <p>
                        Did you know? Humans waste <strong>1 billion meals every single day</strong>.
                        That is enough to feed all the hungry people in the world!
                        But right now, we throw it in the trash while our neighbors go to sleep hungry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>KindBite fixes this.</strong> If you have extra food, don't throw it away.
                        Use our app to give it to someone nearby who needs it.
                        It takes just one photo to save a meal and help a person.
                    </p>

                        No waste. No hunger. Just kindness.
